    <p> In order for the resource to not seem too monotonous and boring on the one hand,
      and not to cause irritation on the one hand, the optimal combination of colors in web design should be used. </p>
      <ul class="section">
        <li> a base color to highlight the main content;</li>
        <li> additional shade for background information that will be in harmony with the underlying;</li>
        <li> a background color that should be calm and unable to obscure the base and extra shades;</li>
        <li> accentuating fonts that could be used to attract visitors.</li>
      </ul>

    <p> Choosing these shades, you need to start with the theme of the site,
 the corporate identity of the company and the type of target audience.</p>

Choosing the right font for the site is not only a matter of attractiveness of the site design,
 but also a question of ensuring the necessary level of usability.
 In most cases, the wrong font on the site often leads to the reluctance of visitors to read into the textual content
  of the pages and provokes them to leave the site almost immediately after opening.
To choose the primary font for your site (content font), it's important to remember that: </p>

         <li> its headset should be supported by any computer;</li>
         <li>its size should be comfortable for most visitors;</li>
         <li>its color should be contrasted with that of the background.</li>
       </ul>
